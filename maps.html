					<h2>5 Amazing Minecraft Maps</h2>

					<p>
						1. Republic of Union Islands<a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/union-islands-project---100th-pmc-subscribers-special/">(Download)</a>
							<br>
							<br>
						This minecraft map made by Frederick Tacla is a realistic fictional country in Minecraft, All I have to say is that it is huge and you should definitely check it out.
							<br>
							<br>
						2. Herobrine's Mansion<a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/herobrines-mansion-adventure-map.200/">(Download)</a>
							<br>
							<br>
						Herobrine’s Mansion is the work of Hypixel, one of the community’s most respected creators. It map is packed with things to find, including custom enemies, half a dozen bosses, special items, and unique potions. Widely regarded as one of the best adventure maps, it is designed to be played with friends, but it can be enjoyed on your own too.
							<br>
							<br>
						3. Kingdom of the Sky<a href="https://www.minecraftxl.com/kingdom-sky-adventure-map/">(Download)</a>
							<br>
							<br>
						Kingdom of the Sky adds the rather novel concept of narration, provided by a series of YouTube videos to which the player is given at key points. It is a little bit like listening to the audio logs in System Shock or BioShock, as you can carry on playing while the narration chats away to you. Even if you ignore them you still have an imaginative and expansive high fantasy map to explore.
							<br>
							<br>
						4. Skyblock<a href="https://www.minecraftmaps.com/survival-maps/skyblock">(Download)</a>
							<br>
							<br>
						SkyBlock, like Survival Island above, is one of the ‘original’ custom Minecraft maps; it lacks frills and vistas, but offers a rock-solid challenge. Just take the scavenging suffering of Survival Island and suspend it thousands of feet in the sky. Your little L-shaped dirt pile is the only resource you have, and, thus, plenty of ingenuity and a mind for conservation is required. With the right smarts, you will be amazed what you can harvest from a tree and several blocks of dirt.
							<br>
							<br>
						5. Atropos<a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/atropos/">(Download)</a>
							<br>
							<br>
						Atropos is an astonishing Minecraft city built atop a tortoise. Not just a whimsical ideal, Atropos is also created in the steampunk art style: everything is adorned with brass pipes and clockwork gears. It is so detailed that, for example, the surface of the tortoise itself is a mass of interconnected metal plates and cogs. But that’s just the start.
